# Machine-Learning-with-Neural-Network [CSC A2]
This is a project from the Machine Learning course from the University of Toronto.

## Linear Regression with Feature Mapping
Implemented linear regression to fit a non-linear function.

## Probalistic Multi-class Classfication
Implemented 3 different models 
  1. Logistic Regression
  2. Gaussian/Quadratic Discriminative Analysis
  3. Gaussian Naive Bayes

## Introduction to Neural Network 
Implemtend Multi Layer Perceptron Classifier(MLP) with logistic regression
Plotted different classfier with difference intitalization/input.
Tested each classifier's accuracy and Cross Entropy

## Used Neural Network to improve image recognition
Direct use of MLP classifier on dataset used previously project to further improve the goal to recognize digits from 0-9.
